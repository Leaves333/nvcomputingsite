# Problem of the Week

Welcome to the POTW page! Every Computing Team meeting has a coding challenge that's due before the next meeting starts. 

## Rules

* Submissions are due 2:29PM Thursdays, right before the next meeting starts (where we'll explain the solution). 

* Original submissions that produce the correct output earn 4 points

* Original submissions that produce an incorrect output but demonstrate effort earn 2 points. 

* Late submissions, if the code is original and produces the correct output, earn 2 points. 

* Any other submissions earn nothing. 

**Use of AI or sharing code is prohibited and will led to disciplinary action. Feel free to ask for help or share insights on our Discord server.** 

## Contents

Problems will be centered around a certain theme. Each one demands a unique algorithm to come to the correct output. 

Contestants are encourage to diversify their knowledge of algorithms through [CPH](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf) and [This list of algorithms](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf)
