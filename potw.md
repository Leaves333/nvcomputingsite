Welcome to POTW! We will be posting a new algorithmic, competitive programming problem every week, in which you are meant to write a computer program to solve that problem with the test data (input) provided through a google drive link. 

POTW is optional - however, we highly recommend it if you want to climb the leaderboards, gain a spot in the ACSL Senior division or catch the attention of the captains.
 
## Rules
* Submissions are due 2:25 PM on Thursdays, before the next meeting.
